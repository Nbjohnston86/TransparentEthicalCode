# Known Tasks to update before committing to version 1.0

This is just the list of currently known issues that, I, the author, have identified as issues preventing both the ethical guide creation and the review ethical code from reaching a 1.0 (Finalized) status.

## Transparent Ethical guide creation 1.0

These are known and potetial improvements that could be made to the transparent ethical guide creation. Creation of this guide takes priority, as the second guide cannot be finalized without this first one being finalized.

- [x] Add Contributors document
- [ ] Link repository on a public forum somewhere to get feedback
- [ ] Add that ethical guide must be version controlled in a version control system
- [ ] Add to ethical code that the official formatted text document as GitHub's version of .md format
  - [ ] Re-Create the original, formatted document using the .md file format
  - [x] Leave original formatted document for historical purposes
    - [ ] Explain historical reason of that document in ethical code
- [ ] Create clause to not use unofficial draft versions as ethical code until it reaches at least a 1.0 version
  - [ ] Explain that the draft versions can be included for version control/historical purposes, but not used in an official capacity
  - [ ] Explain reasoning for this in guide
    - [ ] Version 1.0 should be 'production-ready', so to speak
- [ ] A versioning scheme clearly identified: 
  - [ ] Must build upon existing scheme that is currently written in draft
  - [ ] Explain that draft versions should have DRAFT at top and bottom
  - [ ] Explain that initial versions without a previous, draft finalized edition should be version 0.1
  - [ ] Explain that unfinalized versions should have a d in the version (unless version 0.1)
    - [ ] There is no 0.1d, as the draft is implied.
    - [ ] 1.1d would be the draft version of the now upcoming and unfinalized 1.1
  - [ ] Finalized versions should go to its own finalized folder, and once it's there, it does NOT get changed
  - [ ] Drafts -> Finalized
    - [ ] Should be labeled FINALIZED DRAFT, so version history can be checked, 
    - [ ] Once it receives this status, no more changes
    - [ ] Create new whole versioned copy with FINALIZED DRAFT removed into Final folder
      - [ ] This is the only change allowed from draft to whole version
    - [ ] Formatted drafts and Finals must not change the word-based text contents of the draft or Final it is derived from
      - [ ] Formatting changes are the ONLY approved changes
        - [ ] Only exception, you cannot make text illegible with formatting changes
      - [ ] Formatting changes can change ONLY the formatting as often as desired without the need for the "c" correction
    - [ ] If a new permutation is required: 
      - [ ] IF it is a correction:
        - [ ] A New draft file must be made
        - [ ] A new draft version must be incremented 1.0 -> 1.1c1d (correction 1 draft)[^correctionDraft]
      - [ ] IF it contains new contents (a revision)
        - [ ] A New draft file must be made
        - [ ] A new draft version must be incremented 1.0 -> 1.1d
- [ ] Removals must be identified from source document, with justification
- [ ] Changelog dates
  - [ ] Can be compressed when merged
    - [ ] Edit Date Start
    - [ ] Merge Date
- [ ] Correction notice when failing to abide by terms
- [ ] When updating/switching from one ethical guide version to another, include a plain-text diff
  - [ ] Optional, but encouraged: Graphical version of said diff
- [ ]  Define terms used in ethical guide

## Game reviewer transparent ethical guide 1.0

These are known and potetial improvements that could be made to the transparent ethical game reviewer guide the first guide creates.

## Game reviewer transparent ethical guide addition 1.0

These are transparent ethical guideliness that should not be bound to the original guide, but is most definitely something I want to encourage on the website I plan to eventually create from this. As an added bonus, this includes a great example of an "additional" ethical code.
  
- [ ] Encourage Media Literacy Education
  - [ ] Byline
  - [ ] Date
  - [ ] Other Information

## Journalism... addition? Or another separate code?

While the main website's goals are game review-oriented, a long-term goal to expand into game-based news may not be a bad idea. It's possible to create this as another part of the larger application. But this is a much bigger, more ambitious goal. It should not hold back the original reviewer site's creation.

## Footnotes



[^correctionDraft]: This may be overkill. The point of this is to create a history for the transparent ethical guide, not overload the file system with tons and tons of drafts. Then again, a correction should be discussed, and maybe even grouped together? Perhaps correction drafts should at least get its own folder for organizational purposes.

[^extra]: I have recategorized this as an "Extra". Is this a style guide or a transparent ethical guide? They may be related. I think in the end that all three of the types of the "Main" reviews should be considered, but a "humorous", or "Truly Opinionated" review just requires transparency.

[^optional]: May not include this in final document, requires discussion, as it could be a *lot* of *tedious* work, especially depending on the game. I may leave it in as an optional part of ethical guide. Possible workarounds could be to enumerate a fixed number of mechanics with disposition, but even that seems more like a personal style, rather than an ethical guideline. It also could be redundant with the Disposition to genre section.
