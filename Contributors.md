## Contributors by Name, UserName, and Pseudonym

This list is for those who want to their real names to be how they have contributed, it will also include (If applicable): GitHub Username, and Pseudonym. This is to avoid repetition in the lists that follow.

Currently empty

## Contributors by UserName

This list is for those who want their username to be how they have contributed. I recommend including this, even if you have included your real name. This is intended specifically for GitHub users, if you wish to contribute from a non-GitHub username, we reccomend the Pseudonym section.


## Contributors by Pseudonym

This list is for those who wish to have contributed by a name other than the other two categories. We reccomend this for those who wish to contribute, but not via GitHub. 

For example, when the author reaches out in a public forum, an e-mail address without it's `@` postfix; e.g if someone contributed with johndoe@gmail.com, we would include them as something similar to "username johndoe from an email". When contributing, please state how you wish to be attributed. If you want to be identified by another website, we can include that.

## Number of Anonymous Contributors

This is difficult to pull off, due to needing to reference the original source material where possible, as defined in the ethical code. But since it's technically possible (such as an anonymous letter received in the mail, or an in-person conversation where they ask not to be attributed) the number of those contributors will be mentioned here, as well as the method of anonymity. This is probably an unnecessary, and maybe even the most innacurate step, but I personally think it's important to keep track along the way.

Total Anonymous Contributors: 1
Anonymous Contributors by request: 1
